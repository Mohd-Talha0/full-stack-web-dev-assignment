    <h1>Is HTML a programming language?</h1>
    <p>HTML is not a computer programming language for three reasons:<hr>
       - It does not allow for the use of variables. <br>
       - It does not allow for the use of conditional statements. <br>
       - It does not provide any iterative looping structures.
    </p>
