The `var()` function is used to define and use custom properties, also known as CSS variables. CSS variables allow us to store and reuse values throughout the stylesheet. This can be particularly useful for maintaining consistency and making it easier to update styles across a website.

Here's a brief explanation of how `var()` works:

1. **Variable Declaration:**
   You define a variable using the `--` prefix, followed by a name. For example:
   ```css
   :root {
     --main-color: #3498db;
   }
   ```

2. **Using `var()`:**
   Once a variable is declared, you can use the `var()` function to reference it elsewhere in your stylesheet. For example:
   ```css
   .header {
     background-color: var(--main-color);
   }
   ```

3. **Fallback Values:**
   You can provide a fallback value in case the variable is not defined or supported by the browser:
   ```css
   .header {
     background-color: var(--main-color, #3498db);
   }
   ```

4. **Dynamic Changes:**
   CSS variables can be dynamically changed using JavaScript, allowing for more flexible and responsive styling.

Using `var()` enhances maintainability and makes it easier to update the style of a website by modifying the variable value at a central location (such as the `:root` selector) rather than manually changing each occurrence of a specific color or other property.
