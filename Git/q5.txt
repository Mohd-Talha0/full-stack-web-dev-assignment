Contributing to an open-source project on GitHub involves several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Fork the Repository: Navigate to the project's repository on GitHub and click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. Clone the Forked Repository: On your forked repository page, click the green "Code" button and copy the repository's URL. Then, in your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to store the project and use the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL to clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Create a Branch: Before making any changes, create a new branch for your contribution. Use the `git checkout -b` command followed by a descriptive branch name to create and switch to the new branch.

4. Make Changes: Make your desired changes to the project files using a text editor or IDE. Ensure that your changes adhere to the project's coding standards and guidelines.

5. Commit Changes: Once you've made your changes, stage them for commit using the `git add` command followed by the filenames or directories of the changed files. Then, commit the changes to your local repository using the `git commit` command with a descriptive commit message.

6. Push Changes: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the `git push` command followed by the name of the branch you created.

7. Create a Pull Request (PR): On your forked repository page on GitHub, you should see a banner indicating that you've pushed a new branch. Click the "Compare & pull request" button next to it. Review your changes, provide a descriptive title and description for your PR, and then click the "Create pull request" button.

8. Discuss and Iterate: Project maintainers and collaborators will review your pull request and provide feedback or request changes. Be responsive to their feedback and make any necessary revisions to your code. You can continue to push new commits to your branch, and the PR will automatically update.

9. Merge Pull Request: Once your pull request has been approved and all discussions have been resolved, a project maintainer will merge your changes into the main project repository. Congratulations, you've successfully contributed to the open-source project!

10. Sync Your Fork: Periodically, you may want to sync your forked repository with the upstream repository (the original repository from which you forked). This ensures that your fork is up-to-date with any changes made in the main project repository. To do this, add the upstream repository as a remote using the `git remote add` command and then fetch and merge changes from the upstream repository using `git fetch` and `git merge`.

By following these steps, you can effectively contribute to open-source projects on GitHub and collaborate with the wider community of developers.
