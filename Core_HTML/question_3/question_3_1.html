    <p>This page provides information about my career journey. I have completed my schooling from Lucknow, India. I then pursued my Bachelor (Honours) and Master studies in Physics from Aligarh Muslim University where I chose particle physics as my specialization and did an internship in the field of neutrino physics. After my time in Aligarh I moved to France where I was granted admission to a one year master program in subatomic and astroparticle physics where I worked with the JUNO collaboration and developed a new reconstruction algorithm for the JUNO Top Tracker by using the Hough Transform method. After my studies and work in France I moved to Germany as a research assistant in the ATLAS group where I worked on the implementation and testing of the General Track Fitting Algorithm on the CPU. Now, due to some unforeseen circumstances, I have to return to India. I have decided to switch my career path to become a successful full stack developer and find my first job in the IT industry. I am confident in my abilities and believe that the PW Team will provide the much needed resources and guidance that would help me in my future endeavors.</p>
