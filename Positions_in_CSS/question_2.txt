Difference between Absolute and Relative Positioning:

1- Reference Point:

Relative Positioning: The position of an element with relative positioning is determined relative to its normal position in the document flow. If you move an element with relative positioning, it will be offset from where it would have been in the normal flow, but it won't affect the positioning of other elements.
Absolute Positioning: The position of an element with absolute positioning is determined relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, it's relative to the initial containing block, usually the <html> element. This means an absolutely positioned element can be taken out of the normal flow of the document.

2- Document Flow:

Relative Positioning: Elements with relative positioning still occupy space in the normal document flow. The space they would have occupied before the positioning is preserved, and other elements are positioned as if the relatively positioned element is still in its normal place.
Absolute Positioning: Elements with absolute positioning are taken out of the normal document flow. This means that other elements are positioned as if the absolutely positioned element doesn't exist. It can overlap with other elements, potentially causing them to be visually obscured.

3- Interaction with Sibling Elements:

Relative Positioning: Elements with relative positioning can affect the positioning of their sibling elements. If you move a relatively positioned element, it may push or pull its siblings as it moves within the document flow.
Absolute Positioning: Elements with absolute positioning don't affect the positioning of their siblings. They are removed from the normal flow, so their movement or size changes won't impact the layout of other elements at the same level in the hierarchy.
