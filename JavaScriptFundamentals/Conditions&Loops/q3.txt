Loops are essential programming constructs that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times, based on a specified condition or a set of conditions. They are crucial for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over collections of data, making programs more efficient and concise.

- Why Do We Need Loops?
Loops are necessary because they:

1) Automate Repetitive Tasks: Instead of writing the same code multiple times, loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly with minimal coding effort.
2) Process Collections: Loops iterate over arrays, objects, or other collections to perform operations on each element.
3) Dynamic Control Flow: Loops provide a way to dynamically control the flow of execution based on changing conditions or data.

Types of Loops in JavaScript:

1. for Loop:
The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a block of code. It's commonly used for iterating over arrays or performing a fixed number of iterations.

Syntax:
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
    // Block of code to be executed repeatedly
}

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}

2. while Loop:
The while loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It's suitable when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

Syntax:
while (condition) {
    // Block of code to be executed repeatedly
    // Condition must eventually become false to exit the loop
}

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    i++;
}


3. do-while Loop:
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false.

Syntax:
do {
    // Block of code to be executed repeatedly
    // Condition must eventually become false to exit the loop
} while (condition);

let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
