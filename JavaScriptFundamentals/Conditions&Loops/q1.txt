Conditional statements in programming are used to make decisions based on conditions. They allow the program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. Conditional statements are fundamental for implementing logic and controlling the flow of execution in programs.

- Types of Conditional Statements in JavaScript:

1) if Statement:
The if statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

Syntax:
if (condition) {
    // Block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}

let age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are an adult."); // Output: "You are an adult."
}

2) if-else Statement:
The if-else statement executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.

Syntax:
let hour = 14;

if (hour < 12) {
    console.log("Good morning."); // Output: "Good morning."
} else {
    console.log("Good afternoon."); // Output: "Good afternoon."
}
