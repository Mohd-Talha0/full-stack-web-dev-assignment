Solution:

function checkVotingEligibility(age) {
    let result = age < 18 ? "You cannot vote" : "You can vote";
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
let age1 = 20;
let age2 = 16;

console.log("Age:", age1, "-", checkVotingEligibility(age1)); // "Age: 20 - You can vote"
console.log("Age:", age2, "-", checkVotingEligibility(age2)); // "Age: 16 - You cannot vote"
