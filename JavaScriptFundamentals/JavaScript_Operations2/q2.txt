solution:
In JavaScript, the comma operator , serves two primary purposes: as a separator in variable declarations and function arguments, and as an operator that evaluates multiple expressions, returning the value of the last expression.

Usage of Comma Operator:
- Separation in Declarations and Arguments: The comma operator allows concise declaration of variables and passing of multiple arguments to functions.
- Evaluation of Expressions: When used as an operator, it evaluates multiple expressions and returns the value of the last expression.
- Usage in Loops: It's commonly used in loops and complex expressions to execute multiple statements in a single line.

Example: 
Variable Declarations:
let a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;
console.log(a, b, c); // Output: 1 2 3
