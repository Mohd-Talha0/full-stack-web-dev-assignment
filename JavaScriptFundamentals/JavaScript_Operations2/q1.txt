Ternary Operator in JavaScript
The ternary operator is a concise way to write conditional expressions in JavaScript. It's often used as a shorthand for simple if-else statements when assigning values or executing expressions based on a condition.

Syntax:
The syntax of the ternary operator is:
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse

Example: Checking Even or Odd Using Ternary Operator
Here's a program that uses the ternary operator to determine whether a number is even or odd:

function checkEvenOrOdd(number) {
    let result = number % 2 === 0 ? "even" : "odd";
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 7;

console.log(num1 + " is " + checkEvenOrOdd(num1)); // "10 is even"
console.log(num2 + " is " + checkEvenOrOdd(num2)); // "7 is odd"
