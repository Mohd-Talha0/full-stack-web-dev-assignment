Q3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.
Answer:
In JavaScript, there are five primitive data types. These data types represent the most basic forms of data that can be used in JavaScript programming. Hereâ€™s a list and description of each:

1) Number:

Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.

let age = 25;           // integer
let temperature = 98.6; // floating-point

2)  String:
Represents sequences of characters used for text.

let greeting = "Hello, World!";
let name = 'Alice';
let sentence = `The year is ${new Date().getFullYear()}.`;


3) Boolean:
Represents a logical entity and can have two values: `true` or `false`.

let isJavaScriptFun = true;
let isCompleted = false;

4) Undefined
Represents the absence of a value. A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value is undefined.

let unassignedVariable;
console.log(unassignedVariable); // undefined

5) Null
Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is a special keyword denoting a null value.

let emptyValue = null;
