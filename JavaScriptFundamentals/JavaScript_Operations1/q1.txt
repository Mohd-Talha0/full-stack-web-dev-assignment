Q1: Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming.
Answer:
Operators in JavaScript are symbols that perform operations on operands (variables and values). They are essential in programming because they allow developers to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as arithmetic calculations, comparisons, logical operations, and more.

Importance of Operators in Programming

- Perform Calculations: Arithmetic operators are fundamental for performing mathematical computations, which are essential in a wide range of applications.
- Make Decisions: Comparison and logical operators enable conditional logic, allowing programs to make decisions and execute different code paths based on specific conditions.
- Manipulate Data: Assignment operators are used to store and update values in variables, facilitating data manipulation and state management.
- Streamline Code: Operators like the ternary operator provide concise syntax for common programming patterns, making code more readable and maintainable.
- Interact with Types: Type operators help manage and verify data types, ensuring that operations are performed correctly and safely.
