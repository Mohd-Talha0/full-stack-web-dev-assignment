Q3 Differentiate between unary and binary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.
Answer:
In JavaScript, operators can be classified based on the number of operands they act upon. The two main classifications are unary operators and binary operators.

1) Unary Operators
Unary operators operate on a single operand. They perform various operations such as incrementing, decrementing, negating, or inverting the value of the operand.

Examples of Unary Operators:
- Unary Plus (+)
let str = "5";
let num = +str; // num is 5 (number)

- Unary Negation (-)
Negates the value of its operand.

let x = 10;
let y = -x; // y is -10

- Increment (++)
Increments the value of its operand by one.

let count = 1;
count++; // count is 2

2) Binary Operators
Binary operators operate on two operands. They perform a variety of operations including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bitwise operations.

Examples of Binary Operators:

- Addition (+)
Adds two operands.
let sum = 5 + 3; // sum is 8

- Modulus (%)
Returns the remainder of the division of two operands.
let remainder = 10 % 3; // remainder is 1
